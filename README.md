# Python Geometry Learning Tool

## Overview

**Python Geometry Learning Tool** is an educational application designed to assist students in learning 2D geometry through interactive visualizations and calculations. Built using Python, this tool enables students to draw, manipulate, and compute properties of basic 2D geometric shapes such as points, lines, triangles, squares, and circles. The application aims to enhance the learning experience by integrating programming with geometric concepts, fostering a deeper understanding and engagement with the subject.

## Features

- **Interactive Shape Drawing:** Draw and visualize geometric shapes such as points, lines, triangles, squares, and circles.
- **Geometric Calculations:** Calculate geometric properties like area, perimeter, and distances with ease.
- **Real-time Feedback:** Get immediate feedback on your geometric constructions and calculations.
- **User-friendly Interface:** An intuitive interface that is easy to use for students at various levels.
- **Extensibility:** Modular design allows for easy addition of new features and shapes.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- The following Python libraries:
  - `Matplotlib`
  - `Pygame`
  - `Turtle`

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-geometry-learning-tool.git
   cd python-geometry-learning-tool
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
